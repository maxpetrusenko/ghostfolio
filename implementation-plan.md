# Implementation Plan: Communication & Demo Enhancement

## Problem Statement
Current technical approach is solid but presentation lacks clarity, confidence, and user focus. Need to strengthen narrative framing and demo effectiveness.

## Goals
1. Replace uncertain language with data-backed confidence
2. Frame technical choices as pragmatic decisions with clear rationale
3. Shift demos from tool-driven to user-driven flows
4. Make verification systems visible to users
5. Show stronger command of system design

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Messaging Framework (1-2 days)
- [x] Create tradeoff communication framework
- [x] Develop technical choice messaging templates
- [ ] Practice key scenarios until natural
- [ ] Prepare talking points for major technical decisions

### Phase 2: Demo Enhancement (2-3 days)
- [x] Design user-driven demo scenarios
- [ ] Implement visible verification indicators
- [ ] Create confidence breakdown displays
- [ ] Build real-time status indicators
- [ ] Rehearse user-focused narrative

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 days)
- [ ] Update existing demos with new framework
- [ ] Add verification signals to UI components
